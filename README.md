# Gpt-scrape
A web scraper that uses chatgpt to summarize the page
they are basically the same scrape_summarize has a 300 token limit 
you can change this ..

run $ export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-goes-here"


sum-scrape is the final refinement the others still work but the final saves the api (locally on your machine)

ANTI FEATURES please know the pricing prior to use while
chatgpt is inexpensive it does cost something and that is something to 
beware of
