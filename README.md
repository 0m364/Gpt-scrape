# Gpt-scrape
A web scraper that uses chatgpt to summarize the page
they are basically the same scrape_summarize has a 300 token limit 
you can change this ..

tested woth 5000 tokens successfully still left at 300 because there are diminished returns
since it only gives a summary... if you need different data stored i can make that happen as well

run $ export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-goes-here"
 (win) CMD $ setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-key-goes-here"

rename or delete file "scraped" between scrapings or mod the code to keep adding to it.. 

sum-scrape is the final refinement (of the web page summarizer) the others still work but the final saves the api (locally on your machine)

ANTI FEATURES please know the pricing prior to use while
chatgpt is inexpensive it does cost something and that is something to 
beware of
